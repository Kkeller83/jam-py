===================================
Tree Element - Project - Groups
===================================

``Groups`` node is where the web app (project) skeleton starts shaping up.

First Pane allows for expansion of ``Groups`` node to show it's children for purpose of navigation.

Second pane shows the already defined children for this node as well as allows for Deletion, Editing and Adding of new children. This is possible by clicking on the three buttons at the bottom of this pane - Delete, Edit and New.

While ``Delete`` and ``Edit`` button are self explanatory, it is the ``New`` button that requires a bit more explanation because the children for "Groups" can be classified into following three categories:

* **Item groups**
  - This type of groups basically result in creation of a standard table and a standard form for that table in the web app.
  - The *main form* for data entry of a typical web app should be defined through this group.
  - The groups named *Journals* and *Catalogs* fall into this category.
  - Creation of this category of group is done through ``Item Group Editor``
* **Table / Details groups**
  - This type of groups result in creation of child tables.
  - The *subforms* used for multiple data entries relative to data on the main form for a typical web app should be defined through this group.
  - The group named *Details* falls into this category.
  - Creation of this category of group is done through ``Table Group Editor``
* Report groups
  - As the name suggests this group consists various reports that can be generated using the web-app or project data.
  - Creation of this category of group is done through ``Report Group Editor``

Now, when the ``New`` button is clicked, it results in a dialog box that prompts user to select the groups category from the three options above as can be seen in the image below:

Once the category is selected corresponding editor is opened for entering the details to create the group.

Each editor is now explained in detail below:

.. include:: Groups/item_group_editor.txt

.. include:: Groups/table_group_editor.txt

.. include:: Groups/report_group_editor.txt

Finally the third panel has buttons to edit Client and Server modules of a selected group.
