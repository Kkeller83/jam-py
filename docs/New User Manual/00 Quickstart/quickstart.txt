Quickstart
==========

Assuming you have python environment already setup and your python version is 3.5 or above and you have the virtual environment enabled, issue the following commands on terminal:


.. code-block:: console
  
    #Inside activated virtual environment
    $ pip install jam.py
    $ mkdir <yourprojectname>
    $ cd <yourprojectname>
    $ jam-project.py
    $ ./server.py

This should open a python shell and you should now be able to access the app already on http://127.0.0.1:8080 and app bulder on http://127.0.0.1:8080/builder.html
