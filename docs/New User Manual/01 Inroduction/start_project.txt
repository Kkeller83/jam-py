=============
Start Project
=============

Now that the project folder is created, we just need to start the server.
To start Jam.py web server run **server.py** script by issuing the command below:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./server.py


Open a Web browser and go to “/builder.html” on your local domain – e.g.,
http://127.0.0.1:8080/builder.html.


.. code-block:: console

    127.0.0.1:8080/builder.html


.. note::
    By default, the server starts on port 8080 but you can specify another port as shown below and then
    use it in a browser. So if the command shown is used then server will run on port 8081 and therefore the
    web application will be accessible from http://127.0.0.1:8081 and it's builder will be accessible from
    http://127.0.0.1:8081/builder.html.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ ./server.py 8081.


In the dialog that will appear, select the language and press OK button or follow
the images to apply changes as applicable.

After language selection is complete, database configuration dialog will be presented.

In the New project dialog box fill in:

* **Caption** - The project / web app name that should be appearing for the end users.
* **Name** - Name of project (task) that will be used in programming code to
  get access to the task object. Should be a short valid python identifier - so it
  should be all lowercase and should not include any spaces or special characters.
* **DB type** — Select database type.

  Now for most basic use cases default sqlite server is good enough and if you are
  new user we would recommend that you stick with sqlite database but
  if you have experience of working on some other database such as MySQL etc.
  you will need to create the database on that platform before completing this
  and rest of the related fields.

  To see examples of Database setup, follow the :doc:`link </admin/project/database>`.


When you press OK, the connection to the database will be checked, and in case
of failure 	an error message will be displayed.

.. note::

    Please note the following requirements:

    * to use **FireBird** database, the python ``fdb`` library must be installed
    * **PostgreSQL** requires ``psycopg2`` library
    * **MySQL** requires ``MySQLdb`` library
    * **Oracle** requires ``cx_Oracle`` library
    * **MSSQL** requires ``pymssql`` library
    * to generate reports **LibreOffice** must be installed


If all the details were entered correctly, a new project will be created and the project tree will appear
in the Application builder.
