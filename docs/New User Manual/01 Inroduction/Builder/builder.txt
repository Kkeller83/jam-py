Builder
=======

Once the server is started the application and builder are accessible from the
browser bringing us to the promised land of minimal command line interaction.
We will now explore all elements of builder in detail but if you want to jump
directly into the action you can skip ahead to the chapter
:doc:`Plan </New User Manual/02 Administrator Guide to build with JAM.Py/plan>`
while dipping in and out of following explanation of Builder elements as and when
you are stuck with something or want to know more about.

When you open the builder using ``127.0.0.1:8080/builder.html`` after completing
steps from previous section, you will be presented with following screen and as
can be seen it has a three main components and a number of elements:

	:alt: Builder Components


1. First pane in image above is referred to as ``Tree`` and lists down all the
building blocks.

2. Second pane in image above shows the details for the "Tree Elements" and allows editing as well
as creation of new elements for each tree item.

3. Third pane in image above shows various buttons that allow actions for the
selected child of the "Tree Element".

In next chapter, we will explore each tree item in its dedicated section
and each section will cover the three panes.
