Tree Element - Task
===================

So far the tree elements were dealing with environment settings for the project to be built with JAM.PY. 
Tree Element Task is the first node that deals directly with the components of the project that will be 
visible, usable or callable from within the project (web app) to be built using JAM.PY.

Selecting the **Task** node in the first pane will take you to the root of the project (web app).
For programming reference, please see :doc:`task tree </programming/task_tree>`.

As you will see the second pane has information about the project (web app) itself which is editable. 
Press the **Edit** button at the bottom of the page to change the name and caption
of the task.

The third pane has some very important actions whih deserve their own chapter but 
for sake of completeness a brief explanation is as shown below.
    
* **Client** and **Server** modules of the task, see 
  :doc:`Working with modules </programming/modules>`, 
  :doc:`Code editor </admin/code_editor>`
  
* **index.html** file from the project root folder that contains project page and 
  templates of the forms.
  See :doc:`Forms </programming/interface/forms>`, :doc:`Code editor </admin/code_editor>` for more details.
  
* **project.css** file from **css** directory of the 
  project root folder where the administratorc an apply css overrides to certain elements.
  See  :doc:`Code editor </admin/code_editor>` for more details.

* **Lookup lists** - This action allows you to set various look-up lists that you 
  may use in your project but do not need / want to store in a table on the database. 
  On click of the action button, a ew dialogue box is opened which allows the administrator to select 
  a lok-up list from the existing lists and edit it or delete it. It also hs the option to add anew look-up list.
  The look up lists defined here are available for al the forms inthe project (web app) which is why 
  the action is avilable at ``Task`` node which as explained above is the root of the project.
  See :doc:`Lookup lists <lookup_lists>` for more details.
