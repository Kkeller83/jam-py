=========================
Python Install on Windows
=========================

The instructions below are specifically for Windows with an assumption that most users in an office environment will perhaps only have access to Windows environment:

- As the current version of JAM-PY has been fully tested against Python V3.7.x, you may want to download that version from here for `64 bit <https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/python-3.7.6-amd64.exe>`_ and from here for `32 bit <https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/python-3.7.6.exe>`_
- Run the downloaded executable to install python.
- Once installed, open the command prompt by pressing the "windows" logo and typing ``cmd``.
- On the ``command prompt`` type ``python --version``.
- This should show an output like ``Python 3.7.6``.

.. note::

    If not you may need to set the path variable using steps below:

    Open Windows Explorer and type `Control Panel\\All Control Panel Items\\System`

       Click on `Advanced System Settings`

    .. figure:: img/02_Setup_Control_Panel_System.png

       Click on `Environment Variables`

    .. figure:: img/03_Setup_Control_Panel_System.png

       Double click on `Path`. In next window click on `New` and enter the path for Python folder on your system

    .. figure:: img/04_Setup_Control_Panel_System.png

While path for Python folder may differ based on what path you chose while executing the installer script from first step,
typical path is something like shown below replacing <UserName> with what you have on your system:

``C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32``

and you may also want to nclude on path the folowing entry replacing <UserName> with what you have on your system:

``C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\Scripts``
